The method sounds flippantly easy, but the trick is getting the proportions of everything right.

I used to make this recipe with 30 avocadoes at a time, so there was a bit more margin for error, but you can go a long way by simply adjusting the lemon juice and salt.

### Ingredients

- 2 avocados peeled and mashed
- 1 small red onion finely chopped
- 1 small tomato finely chopped
- juice of a lemon
- 1/2 small clove of garlic mashed
- 1 small bunch of coriander finely chopped
- 1 red chilli finely chopped
- salt

### Method
- Mix everything together
