Makes around 6

You can also do these straight in a dry (no oil) frying pan if you can't be arsed turning the oven on (or don't have one).

If you're taking these camping, wrap them individually in a double layer of silver foil and toast them on the barbecue or propped up next to the fire. If you've managed to get it together to set a fire in the morning, I tip my hat to you.

### Ingredients

- 3 medium potatoes in 1cm cubes
- 1 tin of beans - drain off some of the juice, but reserve it
- bunch of spring onions chopped
- 150g cheese
- 1 pack sausages
- 1 egg
- 6 wheat tortillas

### Method
- Cover the potatoes with water in a saucepan and boil them for 10 mins or until tender
- Fry the sausages and cut into slices
- Mix the potatoes, sausages, spring onions, slightly drained beans, cheese and the egg
- It should be firmish and not too sloppy, if it's too dry and some bean juice
- Take a tortilla and dollop a sixth of the mixture just below the halfway point
- Fold the edge nearest to you so it is a thrid of the way up
- Fold in the edges
- Roll the whole thing up and lay, seam side down on a baking tray
- Repeat with the rest of them
- Bake in the oven for 10 mins until slightly browned
