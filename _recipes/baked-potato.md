If you impale the potato on a metal skewer or even a table knife it will cook faster through the middle

Punching it is good for the soul and also makes the flesh fluffier

### Ingredients

- 1 large potato
- salt

### Method
- Set the oven to 200C
- Stab all over the potato with a fork
- Rinse under water
- Sprinkle with salt
- Bake in the oven for at least half an hour, it will probbaly need around 45 mins. Test by squeezing.
- Remove potato from oven
- Remove skewer (if using)
- Wrap potato in a tea towel and give it a big ol' punch
- Try not to hurt yourself
