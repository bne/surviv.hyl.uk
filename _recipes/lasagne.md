This is a race between running out of bolognese, bechamel or space in your baking dish

### Ingredients

- 1 load of [bolgnese sauce]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _recipes/bolognese.md %})
- 1 load of [béchamel sauce]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _recipes/white-sauce.md %})
- 1 500g pack of lasagne (you might not use all of it)
- Cheese

### Method
- Preheat the oven to 200C
- Make the two sauces. It's better if they're slightly runnier than you would normally make them, as the lasagne will soak up the moisture
- Layer a couple of big spoonfuls of bolognese, then béchamel at the bottom of a flat baking dish
- Layer the lasagne on top, then keep going with the layering until you (ideally) reach the rim of the dish with no bolgnese left and enough béchamel to cover the top.
- Grate enough cheese to cover the top layer of béchamel.
- Bake for half an hour or so till the cheese has browned nicely
